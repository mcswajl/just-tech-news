# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Tools used for this application
I used the MySQL2 package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries
I used the Sequelize packages to connect to Express.js API and mySQL database
I used the dotenv (.env) package to store sensetive date, username, and password.
I was provided a schema.sql file and seed files to run and populate my database.
